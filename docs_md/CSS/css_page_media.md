## CSS Paged Media:	
> From w3c:
### Page Terminology:

* **page sheet:** surface of the physical media.
*  **printable area size:** the size of the page sheet **minus** the size of none-printable area.
* **Non-printable area:** The non-printable area is the area of a page sheet that the UA is not capable of rendering content into. This value is UA dependent.

* **Printable area:**

 <br>
 
 * **page box:** A page box is derived from the [box model] and contains portions of the document flow destined for rendering on a page sheet. think it as  like  "viewport". 
 * **page area:** content area page box, also its:
	 * container for all the boxes generated by the root element.
 * **margin area of the page box:**
 * divided into 16 page-margin boxes .
 * each page-margin box has its own margin,border,padding and central areas.
 * typically used to display running headers/footers.
 
### Page types:

A set of pages can have special treatments applied based on the page's place In the document: first, left, and right. <i>The following terminology is used to describe page types:</i>
* **Page Orientation:** as defined by a comparison of the length of a page sheet's edges. When a page sheet is square the long edge is the same length as the short edge **else** the long edge is greater than than the short edge length.
* **Portrait Orientation:**
A portrait page's height is greater than its width. Horizontal elements are parallel to the short edge and vertical elements to the long edge. The **Landscape Orientation**is the opposite.

* **Front Side: **
Media used as a stack of sheets have two sides known as the front and the back. The front side is the side in view. Typically, the UA prints on the front side of the media although it _MAY_ place the page in an output bin after printing so that the back is visible. Media used from a roll or continuous form only have a front side.
* **Back Side:**
The back side of the medium. is only used when printing on both side of the medium.
* **First Page:**
The first page in a set of pages.

* **Facing Pages**

 Facing pages are two pages in order as printed, with the even numbered page on the left and odd numbered on the right. When front and back side printing occurs these two page will face each other in the document.

**Left Page**

The left facing page, usually even numbered. Also called _versos_. The UA distinguishes the left page from the first and right pages. This page will be printed on front side of a medium when printing on only one side of the media and on the back when printing on both sides.

**Right Page**

The right facing page, usually odd numbered. Also called _rectos_. The UA distinguishes the right page from the first and left pages. This is page is always printed on the front of a medium.

**Binding Edge**

The binding edge is the page edge that will be stitched, stapled, or punched with holes when preparing the pages of the document for binding. It is larger than other margins to accommodate the space needed for binding. Usually is the left side of a page when printing in portrait mode on the right page.  However, the :left and :right page selectors allow for binding edges.

## Print Style Sheets:
> from sitepoint.com

 Print CSS can either be:
1.  **Applied in addition to screen styling.** Taking your screen styles as a base, the printer styles override those defaults as necessary.
2.  **Applied as separate styles.** The screen and print styles are entirely separate; both start from the browser’s default styles.

* A print style sheet can be added to the HTML `<head>` after the standard style sheet:
```markup
<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="print.css" />
```
> Note now, The `print.css` styles will be applied in **addition** to screen styles when the page is printed. <b>[hint `media` => output device(screen/print)] </b>
* To separate screen and print media, `main.css` should target the screen only:
```markup
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="main.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="print.css" />
```
* Alternatively, print styles can be included within an existing CSS file using `@media` rules:
```css
/* main.css */
body {
  margin: 2em; color: #fff; background-color: #000;
}
/* override styles when printing */
@media print {
  body {
    margin: 0; color: #000; background-color: #fff;
  }
}
```
* Screen and print rules can also be separated if necessary:
```css
/* main.css */
/* on-screen styles */
@media screen {
  body {
    margin: 2em;
    color: #fff;
    background-color: #000;
  }
}
/* print styles */
@media print {
  body {
    margin: 0;
    color: #000;
    background-color: #fff;
  }
}
```
### Testing Printer Output:
-  The most reliable option is the print preview option in your browser.
- Alternatively, save or preview the page by exporting to a PDF.
- Using DevTools to emulate **print styles**  <em>[the page breaks wont't shown]</em>
	- Chrome:  Select **More Tools** -> Rendering -> Change **Emulate CSS Media** to **print** at the bottom of the panel.
	- Firefox:  Click **Toggle print medaia simulation**

## Prepare content for printing:
* **Remove unnecessary sections** (navigation menus,hero images,headers,footers, forms, sidebars, social media widgets, and advertising blocks (usually anything in an `iframe`):
```css
/* print.css */
header, footer, aside, nav, form, iframe, .menu, .hero, .adslot {
  display: none;
}
```
* **Linearize the Layout:**
* For Flexbox and Grid, if there any issues, cosider using `display:block; or similar on layout boxes and adjust dimensions as necessary. for example: width:100%`;  to span the full page width.

### Printing Styling:
Printer-friendly styling **Recommendations**:
-   ensure you use dark text on a white background.
-   consider using a serif font, which may be easier to read
-   adjust the text size to `12pt` or higher
-   modify paddings and margins where necessary. Standard `cm`, `mm`, or `in` units may be more practical.

### Adopt CSS Columns:
- for standard A4 and US Letter paper, consider using `CSS Columns` in print layout. For Example
```css
/* print.css */
article {
  column-width: 17em;
  column-gap: 3em;
  /*columns will be created when there’s at least `37em` of horizontal space.*/
}
```
* <strong> Use border instead of Background.</strong>
*  <strong>Remove or Invert Images:</strong>
You could consider a default where all images are hidden unless they have a `print` class:
```css
/* print.css */
* {background-image: none !important;}
img, svg {display: none !important;}
img.print, svg.print {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```
* A [CSS filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/filter) can be used to invert and adjust colors in the print style sheet. For example:
```css
/* print.css */
img.dark {
  filter: invert(100%) hue-rotate(180deg) brightness(120%) contrast(150%);
}
```
### Add Supplementary Content:
 The CSS [`content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/content) property can be employed to append text to `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. For example, display a link’s URL in brackets after the text: 
 ```css
/* print.css */
a::after {content: " (" attr(href) ")";}
```
Or you can add print-only messages:
```css
/* print.css */
main::after {
  content: "Copyright site.com";
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
}
```
consider using a class such as `print` on elements which should only be visible when printed,. For example:
```markup
<p class="print">Article printed at 1:23pm 5 September 2020. 
Please see https://site.com/page for the latest version.</p>
```
The CSS:
```css
/* hidden on-screen */
.print {display: none;}
@media print {
  /* visible when printed */
  .print {display: block;}
}
```
## Page Breaks

The CSS3 properties [`break-before`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-before) and [`break-after`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/break-after) allow you control how page, column, or region breaks behave before and after an element. but older browsers may use the similar [`page-break-before`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-before) and [`page-break-after`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-after) properties.
The following `break-before` and `break-after` values can be used:

-   `auto`: the default — a break is permitted but not forced
-   `avoid`: avoid a break on the page, column or region
-   `avoid-page`: avoid a page break
-   `page`: force a page break
-   `always`: an alias of `page`
-   `left`: force page breaks so the next is a left page
-   `right`: force page breaks so the next is a right page

Example: force a page break immediately prior to any `<h1>` heading:

```css
/* print.css */
h1 {break-before: always;}
```
**Note**: be wary of over-using page breaks. Ideally, printer output should use as few pages as possible._

The [`break-inside`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/break-inside) (and older [`page-break-inside`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-inside)) property specifies whether a page break is permitted inside an element. The commonly supported values:

-   `auto`: the default — a break is permitted but not forced
-   `avoid`: avoid an inner break where possible
-   `avoid-page`: avoid an inner page break where possible

This can be preferable to specifying page breaks, since you can use as little paper as possible while avoiding page breaks within grouped data such as tables or images:
```css
/* print.css */
table, img, svg {break-inside: avoid;}
```
* The [`widows`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/widows) property specifies the minimum number of lines in a block that must be shown at the **top** of a page. Imagine a block with five lines of text.
* The [`orphans`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/orphans) property is similar to `widows` except it controls the minimum number of lines to show at the **bottom** of a page.
* The [`box-decoration-break`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/box-decoration-break) property controls element borders across pages. When an element with a border has an inner page break:
-   `slice`: the default, splits the layout. The top border is shown on the first page and the bottom border is shown on the second page.
-   `clone`: replicates the margin, padding, and border. All four borders are shown on both pages.
- Finally, [CSS Paged Media (`@page`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@page) has [limited browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-paged-media) but provides a way to target specific pages so alternative margins or breaks can be defined:
```css
/* print.css */
/* target all pages */
@page {margin: 2cm;}
/* target the first page only */
@page :first {margin-top: 6cm;}
/* target left (even-numbered) pages only */
@page :left { margin-right: 4cm;}
/* target right (odd-numbered) pages only */
@page :right { margin-left: 4cm;}
```
* The CSS page break properties can be placed within your `screen` or `print` styles because they only affect printing.

<b><em>_Add it to your to-do list!_</em></b>
<em>Adding a few page breaks and removing unnecessary sections will delight users and raise your site above competitors.</em>

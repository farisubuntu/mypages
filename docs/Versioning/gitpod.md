# Introduction to Gitpod

[Gitpod][https://www.gitpod.io/]  is an open source platform for automated and  **ready-to-code development environments**  that blends into your existing workflow. It enables developers to describe their dev environment as code and  **start instant and fresh development environments for each new task**  directly from your browser.

At the heart of Gitpod: **an open platform that removes all friction of manually setting up and maintaining dev environments** allowing yourself and your team to build applications quicker and more collaboratively.

## Gitpod Concepts

Gitpod seamlessly integrates in your workflow and works with all major `git` hosting platforms including GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. It understands the context you are in and adjusts your dev environment accordingly. **For example, if you create a Gitpod workspace from a Pull or Merge Request, Gitpod will open a fully-initialized dev environment in code-review mode.**

At its core Gitpod relies on a  **client-server architecture**  where the client can either be:

-   **Any device**  with a browser and internet connection (Gitpod works with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and other Chromium-based browsers]
-   Your  **local machine**  via local VS Code, IntelliJ or simply your shell/terminal where you SSH into your Gitpod workspace (_expected to be released in early Q1/2021_]

### 🗳 Workspace

A workspace comprises(يشمل) your whole development environment and gives you similar capabilities to a Linux machine. Compared to the latter it is however  **pre-configured and optimized for your individual development workflow**. Each workspace includes:

-   Your source code
-   A shell with  [root / sudo capabilities][https://www.gitpod.io/blog/root-docker-and-vscode/#root-access]
-   Your IDE of choice* - currently this is  [VS Code][https://www.gitpod.io/blog/root-docker-and-vscode/#vs-code]  or  [Theia][https://theia-ide.org/]
-   Your personal IDE extensions, themes, editor prefs
-   Full  [Docker support][https://www.gitpod.io/blog/root-docker-and-vscode/#docker]

Your router acts as an central connection point, which wireless clients can connect to.</li><li>Client mode &ndash; The radio interface is used to connect the internet-facing side of the router (i.e., the WAN) as a client to a remote accesspoint. NAT or routing are performed between WAN and LAN, like in "normal" gateway or router mode. Use this mode, e.g., if your internet connection is provided by a remote accesspoint, and you want to connect a subnet of your own to it. </li><li>Client Bridged (Routed) mode &ndash; The radio interface is used to connect the LAN side of the router to a remote accesspoint. The LAN and the remote AP will be in the same subnet (This is called a "bridge" between two network segments). The WAN side of the router is unused and can be disabled. Use this mode, e.g., to make the router act as a "WLAN adapter" for a device connected to one of its LAN ethernet ports.</li><li>Ad-Hoc mode &ndash; This is for peer to peer wireless connections. Clients running in Ad-Hoc mode can connect to each other as required without involving central access points.</li></ul><br /><br /><div class="note"><h4>Note</h4><div>Note that <a href="HWDS.asp">WDS</a> is only available in AP mode.</div></div></dd--><script type="text/javascript">Capture(hwl_basic.page1)</script><!--dt>Wireless Network Mode</dt--><dt><script type="text/javascript">Capture(wl_basic.label2)</script></dt><!--dd>If you have mixed b/g/n devices on your network, then keep the default setting, <i>Mixed</i>.

The SSID must be identical for all devices in the wireless network. It is case-sensitive and must not exceed 32 alphanumeric characters, which may be any keyboard character. Make sure this setting is the same for all devices in your wireless network.<br /><br /><div class="note"><h4>Note</h4><div>For added security, it is recommended to change the default SSID <tt>dd-wrt</tt> to a unique name of your choice.</div></div></dd--><script type="text/javascript">Capture(hwl_basic.page3)</script><!--dt>Wireless Channel</dt--><dt><script type="text/javascript">Capture(wl_basic.label4)</script></dt><!--dd>Select the appropriate channel from the list provided to correspond with your network settings (in North America between channel 1 and 11, in Europe 1 and 13, in Japan all 14 channels). All devices in your wireless network must use the same channel in order to function correctly.
